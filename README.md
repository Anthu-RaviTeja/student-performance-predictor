This project uses machine learning techniques to predict a student's academic performance based on various factors such as study hours, past scores, and attendance. It's a practical, beginner-friendly Python project to showcase ML skills on a resume or GitHub.

objective:
To build a model that can help educational institutions identify students who are likely to underperform and provide necessary support.

Technologies Used :
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
IDE/Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Dataset Features:
 Gender
 Study Hours
 Attendance %
 Internet Access (Yes/No)
 Past Exam Scores
 Participation in Extra Activities

Workflow
1.Data Preprocessing
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.Model Building: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
4.Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
5.(Optional): Deploy model with Streamlit

Results
 Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest
 Visualized feature importance
 Built an easy-to-use model for educational insights

How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook student_performance_predictor.ipynb
```

Future Enhancements
 Add more features like parental education level
 Streamlit or Flask-based web UI
 Use real-time school data with consent
